# How to use Windows Explorer to access remote file over SSH

**What do you need**
- WSL2 with Ubuntu installed on Windows 10 OS. I have Ubuntu 20.04 installed but I believe any other Linux distros may work the same.

**How to**
1. Open Wsl2 terminal create mount folder in home directory. I created a folder name "~/sshfs". (Folder in Windows' host doesn't work in my experiment)

1. Open /etc/fuse.conf. Uncomment the following line.

    ```
    user_allow_other
    ```

1. Mount the folder using

    ```
    sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions serverUser@serverAddress:/home/folderToMount ~/sshfs
    ```

1. cd to the folder and open Windows Explorer using the command

    ```
    explorer.exe .
    ```
