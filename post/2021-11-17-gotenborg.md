# GÖtenburg the lesson
I have to admit that I am lucky that I have this job (story for another time...). This time we have a PI (Program Increment) meeting in a GÖtenburg, Sweden. 

## Sweden
I asked myself where is Sweden. Then my 33 years knowledge only told me that Sweden is probably somewhere very cold in Europe. What else do I know about this country? Probably Volvo and Ikea!!! There are more brands from Sweden such as Electrolux, Fjall Raven, Saab Car.


## Everything minimal
It's common to see minimal furniture ... Yes I am a big fan of Ikea. Why do I like Ikea? Ikea is afforadable even in a third-world country like Thailand, they made quality products and of course the designs that emphasize function with as little form as possible -- Minimalistic. 

I think Swedish (People & Language) is also minimalistic. People speaks very few words in a sentence compared to other countries, especially Singaporean. Sentences are very reservered and only meaningful keywords present.

## Winter black
My jacket is brown. It's not a color that stands out.

## The Dutch and Max Verstappen
More than half of my colleagues are from Dutch. Watching F1 races in the Netheland, I saw most of the crowd wearing orange shirt in the grandstand, then the comentaries spoke about how Dutch are here for Max. (Dutch color is orange. Max is an F1 racing driver. He is Dutch) During one of the beer session, someone talks about F1 and I was asked who was my favorite driver. Not Max... I could feel that I am facing a Max's fan haha. Such feeling I can't get from watching on TV.
