# Goodbye Simracing Rig
This DIY project is probably one of the highest utility ones. Now it's time to say goodbye to the new home. I sold it on fb marketplace. 

Racing simulator is my favorite game since I was a kid and it remains the only genre of games that I am ready to pay for. With Playstation1, I and my dad we played Gran Turismo 1 together in a small room under the stairs (before we renovated our house). It was an intense racing game as child who likes to crash their car and expect the car to bounce back, accelerate fast and over take the AI.

During middle school, I did a small part-time job with my best friend to setup a wifi for his aunt. We earned a little money which we spent on Logitech Momo Racing wheel. (He still keeps it to-date) It was my actually first experience of driving the force feedback wheel, break and accel pedal, driving / drifting in Need for speed Underground.

4 years ago. I tried to get back into racing game again but now the industries has changed a lot. It's not any more the racing game. They became Simulation-Racing game. Started with Assetto Corsa. I tried with 10-years-old Momo racing wheel. The experince was terrible because the wheel could only turn one round when the newer wheels do 3 rounds (~1000 degrees turning), mimicing the real car.

This Thrusmaster T300 RS was my dream back then. I got a chance to relocate to Singapore and I told myself "it will be the first gift when I land there". Few days after I moved into the apartment I ordered it online. While not having the bank card (debit card) just yet, I went to transfer money to the seller... Since then it became a center piece furniture of my living room ... though not being used as often as I thought.
