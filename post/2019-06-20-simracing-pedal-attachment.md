# Sim-Racing Pedal Attachment
![](image/thrustmaster-pedal-after.jpg)

I had an issue with the height and angle of the accelerator/break pedals because they are too low and too deep in my seating setup, so I designed an attachment (the white plastic piece) which can be bolt on to Thrustmaster T3PA pedal to fix this issue. See youtube video below how I modified the pedals.

The attachment was 3d-printed using PLA plastic on Ender3 at the extrusion width of 0.3mm and 2 walls. Originally, the pedal is crew directly on to the printed plastic using M4 bolt but later I modified the design with M4 nut insert.
