### **The Unicorn Project, Gene Kim**
_Fiction, Read in May 2025_

Right after I finished the first book of this series *The Phoenix Project* and I heard that there's another one following up, I bought this book without any second thought. However, it took me over a year to actually pick it up and resume my reading habit. I'd actually carried this book once in 2025 when I came to Japan hoping that 3 months in Japan would be enough to finish. I ended up never had opened it. This time around in 2025, I came over to Japan for 1 year assignment. I made sure to carry few books and hoping to finish some would be awesome. It was a golden week holiday in Japan when we travels around kansai region. I made sure to carry The Unicorn Project in my backpack. I am surprised that I could pretty much reading it non-stop whenever I have a short break - waiting for food, queuing for attractions at USJ, quick break at Osaka Expo, in the car, before bed, on the beach waiting for dinner, and etc.

The main things that really hook me into reading non-stop was how realistic it reflects my current life at work. Since January I am in constant motions of integrating systems for Haneda airport project. I have been trying the change the way we work, combining dev & ops, automate the build & deploy, doing things end-to-end, motivating continuous learning among teams. These are nothing new and the rebellion gang in the book surprised me with similar approach. After months of trying, I came to the conclusion that I am not good enough to make the change happen. Reality doesn't converge to a happy ending like in the fiction. I will need to recollect myself and once again try to overthrow the existing orders.

The key takeaway for me is that we shouldn't get carried away by the status quo / corporate structure and it's important to keep repeating the vision for why we do what we do. Additionally, five ideals are an awesome corner stones how we should do any works.
1. Locality and Simplicity
1. Focus, Flow and Joy
1. Improvement of Daily Work
1. Psychological Safety
1. Customer Focus

### **Exercises in Programming Style, Cristina Videira Lopes**
_Programming, Read in April 2025_

While I was reviewing the code and being so frustrated with the new code someone was trying to add to the legacy codebase, I thought why people wouldn't just take a break and start to think if this is how it should be done or if there's a better way of doing it. Primoz sitting next to me and probably hearing this recurrent complains everyday for couple of days. He gave me a link to this book. 

Unlike any other programming books that tell you this is the best way to solve this constrain / problem. The world is heterogeneous we should start embracing different races / culture / a sour cup of coffee?. The same school of thought can be applied to the programming subject very well. In our company lately, we speak so much about that this is best practices and there's only one way of doing it with microservices, dependencies injection, interface, docker, and etc. I didn't think that was the way but I have no good reason to say why. This book learn me the universe of programmings styles which are definitely much much more biggest than I thought it was. The book explains the very reasons why each styles are developed from the original purposes / constraint that may be already forgotten. Just simply not seeing the style often doesn't mean that it's a bad way of doing it. 

This book is highly recommend for any mid career programmer (which I consider myself one of those) where you came across few projects and about to start to develop your personal bias toward one way-of-working, one technology. We shouldn't frame ourselves to any particular styles but instead enjoy the different beautiful colors and tones.

### **The Accidental Superpower, Peter Zeihan**
_History, Read in April 2025_

In today's company where we work remotely, we rarely have opportunities to do casual talk with colleagues. Meetings are always scheduled for topic. The good thing about working for T-Hive is that there're always opportunities to meet physically and regularly. During one of the PI session (physical meeting), Gasper started talking about books that he's read and he recommended me this one that he finished lately. From his description, it was likely from the category that I would be interested in but it was quite thick and hard to carry around.

I am always curious how USA has become the most powerful country that dictates the course of today history. I am always curious why it wasn't my home country which way we are inferior and can we change the course of future history. Everyone I talked to has their own theory about it. This book likewise offer another theory that roots on geography which was unheard of from me. It was not so easy to follow because there are vocabularies that I am totally familiar with (politics..) and the whole map. I need to have google maps on my hand to locate the countries, rivers, regions that are mentioned in the book. It's always very interesting the learn about the history, relationships, and countries dynamics just by looking at where the countries it situated alone.

As much as the theory and predictions given from the book sounded but I wouldn't call it a grand theory -- single theory that is a root to every derivative. And I would still be optimist and believe that society will continues democratize and decentralize in the age of information & innovation where geography plays lesser roles. It may take time. Any dominant positions are temporal. Humanity will find ways to make the world a better place for every individual.

### **The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Douglas Adams**
_Fiction, Read in December 2024_

It's hard to find a fiction book that I like to work on. Once mentioned by a friend (Dr.Fai), the title of this book draw me in because of my slight interests in space travels. It has been advanced so much and it has never been closer to the reality as it's today. However, this fiction written in 80's is still hold valid and exciting even in the context of the year that we are in. 

While reading, I got to learn about 'Galaxy songs' from Monty Python. Listening it along goes very well with the theme of this book. Then I started to listen more and more songs from Monty Python and I like them all.

### **Masters of Doom, Davic Kushner**
_History, Read in August 2024_

Summer this year, I met Stephan in Paris. It's been almost 10 years since the last time we met. I am happy to learn that he has been in 3d printing hobby lately which would have been unthinkable 12 years ago when we studied together in Tokyo. During the dinner, he mentioned this book which immediately trigger my interests so I ordered the book to be delivered to my apartment in The Netherland while the dinner was going on.

Since I joined this company, I have been working mostly on 3D visualization client. Hearing about how DOOM was the very first games that crack 3D rendering could not intrigue me more. On top of that, **IDDQD** is probably the only few cheat code (aside from Family 101 Contra -- up/up/down/down/...) that I can never forget and it's for DOOM! It's very fun to read about the history that is probably as important to the game industry as Windows. I'd really like to recommend this book for anyone who works in Computer Graphic of my generation.

One night I played DOOM again. The graphic was really charming and I think it is much more fun to play now than when I was 12 years old (or something like that).

### **Four thousand weeks, Oliver Burkeman**
_Personal development?, Read in May 2024_

Reading the title, I would expect the book to tell you a trick to do much more (quantity) in your limited life time (lifehack-ish) but I was totally wrong. I know time is invariant to how we spend but why? and what's the quality of time? Thanks to the wife who recommend me this book. 

Based on the definition giving by the book, I would call myself a productivity geek -- I care about how time is being spent -- but at the same time I own the care-free character --I only care that I care (growing up I notice I have less-and-less of such quality). In fact, these two universe merges and well described by the author.

It took me very long to read this book (1 year possibly) because there's so much to digest on top of some difficult vocabularies. Worth reading!

### **A short history of nearly everything, Bill Bryson**
_Science, Read in April 2024_

I like Science, especially Physics which I think it's the ultimate subject among other since subjects. Today's technology is impossible without other sciences - biology, physiology, geology, and many more. I was wrong at overvaluing the Physics over other matters. This book give me a tour to the comprehensive history of sciences. How a discover on one matter subject, helps development in other fields.

I know we are small compared to solar system. I know we are big compared to atoms. But I wouldn't say I truly understand the relative size of the matters. This book explains them well and very easy to comprehend the beauty of mother nature.

### **The Phoenix Project, Gene Kim**
_Fiction, Read in Dec 2023_

This book is probably by far my quickest fiction book to finish. I believe I had only couple of reading sessions on this book (< 10) before I finished it. It's very nerdy fiction about DevOps - Software Developer / System deployment. It feels so real as if something similar is already happening in the current company I am working for. 2 years ago when I started working for this company, I thought devops was something extra / unnecessary but more and more I learn about the principle, more complicated the products get, devops is undeniably the way forward. Now that I practice it day-in-day-out, I feel that devops is just part of the development process - like how ide, git become part of the work flow. This book visualizes to devops can help you in a very easy to read and understand fictional story.

### **The Midnight Library, Matt Haig**
_Fiction, Read in Feb 2023_

(I like it really. But too bad I didn't write my thought here when the memory was fresh.)

### **The Bomber Mafia**
_History, Read in July 2022_

I got this book from Philadelphia airport while I was waiting for the next flight to Louisville. As a side story, I still feel that I am such a lucky one working for this job - challenging work, and giving me chances to visit the world. I finished the previous book during the first 18h hour flight (Bangkok > Doha > Philadelphia), so I went into the book store looking for a new one.

This book caught my eyes as one of the best seller. It didn’t take me too long to finish it because it was relatively thin (150 pages maybe). It talks about the story of army commander during WW2. Good for killing time but nothing much aside..

### **Anxios People, Fredrik Backman**
_Fiction, Read in July 2022_

Whoa!! I almost forgot to write about this book. I am not such a fiction person but my wife really recommend me this one. It’s the first time I feel that I can’t close the book and keep reading till the end. This is the best book I have had for the first half of 2022 so far.

It’s the story of many random things happening in Sweden. The author put together unlikely set of events in the society but when they combined, they made me feel that YES! IT’S SO REAL especially in Swedish setting (me seeing from outside). Imagine to yourself, if you need to write story with all following keywords what would it be - Cashless society / Got fired / Pizza / Housing crisis / Apartment viewing / Same-sex relationship / IKEA / Renovation / Bridge / Psychologist / Police. I can’t imagine a better story!

### **The Unknown Kimi Raikkonen**
_Racing, Read in June 2022_

I picked up this book because it's cheap and at that time he was about to quit F1. On the TV, Kimi has a very distict personalities compared to other driver -- more towards on bullshit talk. This book is a bit different from other racing biography books that I have read. All of the other ones, so far, are written by the F1 reporters or the person himself. Those books offer more inside view of prople in this industry whilst this book is written by a fiction writer. From a non-F1 fan perspective, story is described in a normal fashion. It's more of what this profession is like.

When I was studying Master, I had one Finish friend. I recently transitted in Finland, saw the Moomin cafe, walk passed shops in the airport that made me feel like Japanese-styled European - simple minimal styling. Kimi is another story appended to my Finish story collection.

### **Thinking, Fast and Slow, Daniel Kahneman**
_Psychology, Read in May 2022_

How could you skip a book of the Noble prize? Of course, whatever from Nobel prize has such an illusion but the only way to judjudgeege by yourself whether it's an illusion or something meaningful is by experiencing it. This is one of the book that takes me the longest to finish, so much so that I would like to add ... slow (reading) ... to the title. I carried it to many places / countries I have been visiting in the past year - USA / Sweden / Netherland / many more provinces in Thailand. It's a very good sleeping pill while I am on the airplane -- just because the content is so so heavy. I am glad that I finished it now and it worths reading.

Almost every second page there are mental experiment for the reader to work out. Most of the time you are given 2 choices to choose in different situations. It's easy to skip the mental experimenting part and jump to the summary paragraph but as I have some background in probability (Math), I take time with pen and paper to really use the System 2 (analytic part of the brain) to compute the resulting chances before making decision. Most probably I found my conflicting self as explained through out the book.

I initially thought that I wouldn't read the appendix -- two academic papers written in an even smaller characters. I started looking at it after finishing the last chapter and giving a try. I was hooked up by the nature of hournal paper which is very concise and it recaps the whole thought of this book well. I don't think I would be impressed reading these two journals without going through the book because they are totally different kind of sciences that I got used to.

We human are every emotional (explained as System 1 brain) rather than than rational / logical (System 2 thinking) but that is how we differ ourselves from computer, I think. This book is highly recommended. Only I learn more about Psychology of human beings, I also go to refresh my knowledge on probability theory.

### **Surrounded by idiots, Thomas Erikson**

_Psychology, Read in April 2022_

What a coincident! It's the book that my colleague (who sees himself as blue) and my girlfriend (who sees herself as green) were reading at the same period. I didn't pay much attention back then but after hearing spoils from those people I was curious which color I was exactly. Was I Red/Green/Blue/Yellow?

It's too easy to say that everyone on earth is different. People often say that we should emphatize each other but then how you would translate such ideological thought into daily practice. It's surprised to see what others think/feel under an action/event/situation. People are grouped into 4 types probably to simplify the explanation and most important of all to let the readers reflect/associate themselves as one of the group.

It's funny to see a reflection of myself as a red person - describing in the book. At the same time, it's a hard lesson to learn that something so normal to a red personal trait could hurt other personality.

### **Layered Money, Nik Bhatia**
_History, Read in March 2022_

Bitcoin, Crypto, to be honest I felt skeptical since it's gained so much attention over the past few years, as for trading/buy&sell/making-profit. Until, one of the colleage who is so much into it talks about the story of money when we first met around end of last year. I started to realize that I was way too bias than I actually know about it. I started to learn about Etherium mining. I mined and cashed out the first 10 dollars. Then, it's all started to get interesting. It's such a pity being programmer but actually knowing nothing about this upcoming tech.

After 3 months, I met the same Bitcoin guy for the second time. He talked about this book that he just finished. I am into the book because it's not about Bitcoin or Crypto but it's more about "the history of money". It's interesting to actually learn what's money, how was it developed and to judge by yourself if crypto is a possible/potential/future-proven solution to the leveled economics.

### **Guns Germs & Steels, Jared Diamond**

_History, Read in December 2021_

I am such a person who rarely knows what's popular. This book is another good example that was introduced by my girlfriend. I always wonder about the counties wealthiness. Why is Thailand still a developing coutries? What makes us different from the European countries? The more I travel the world, more I understood that the education plays a major part in today's society but what influences a good education before today. I have never asked myself why. What if you insist on asking why and never satisfy with a simple answer? I believe such thought process had been applied here in this book to find the ultimate proof of 1=1.

The author use a scientic approach (i.e. experiment) on 'History' subject which is particularly interesting to learn how things work similary but also different. This particular part of the book I enjoyed reading the most.

This book compliments "Sapiens" very well. Sapiens talks why humans are superior over other animals. His book talks about the stories among group of human (nations / countries). What has happened and in retrospective why they happened that way.

### **Senna Versus Prost**

_Racing, Read in August 2021_

I have heard this famous duel from almost anybody that is into this sport. When I was watching a Senna documentary on Youtube, I found another replay of Senna driving in the wet unbelivably faster than his competitors. I knew very little about Prost and Niki's book (below) makes me curious to know more about him.

So I have this book. I got to know more about Prost and Senna background. Their lifes before getting into F1 and during the time they are fighting each other at Mclaren. How did the situation develop? However, it says very very little about the events around Senna crash. I think the Senna's documentary that I watched before tells me more on Senna's crashing moment.

---

### **Enzo Ferrari: A Life**

_Racing, Read in 2021_

When I was young I didn't like supercars. They don't look like normal cars. F40 in racing games is so difficult to drive. I used to wonder why people like this brand so much.

Since I drove a Ferrari at Silverstone and watching F1, I started to enjoy learning more about the supercars and Ferrari looks more and more beautiful to my eyes. I always hear commentaries about Ferrari's racing heritages which I had no idea about. So, I bought this book and read it. Hmmm, Yes, Ferrari is about racings. While reading this book, I started browsing photos of classic Ferraris mentioned. They are just so beautiful.

---

### **To Hell and Back, Niki Lauda**

_Racing, Read in 2021_

I knew very little about Niki. He was mentioned on many commentaries but the first time I really wanted to know more about him was around Monaco race when he has just passed away and people pay tributes to him. I started to watch some documentaries about him. Recently, I read a book about him. My personal take was you can pursue many interests in your life (he is a successful driver and he owns the airline).

---

### **The World Atlas of Coffee**, James Hoffmann

_Coffee, Read in 2021_

I like his youtube channel because I think his experiments sound scientific and reproducable. Thought I could hardly taste the different when I tried myself. I simply need more exposure to differential such a little difference.

I like the first half of the book which is about coffee history. Since the main theme of this book is more of the encyclopedia, I think it's no exciting moment when reading. I would like to see more in future book about his thought on coffee things from a fair perspective (more opinion based not factual). The second half I didn't finish it because it is all about coffee growing regions (discretely explained by region). I sometimes revisit this section when I bought a new bean from a new region to learn the background.

---

### **Total Competition**, Ross Brawn and Adam Parr

_Racing, Read in 2021_

Reading about a famous engineering personnel - Brawn - only makes me wanted to be in F1 more. I wish I had such book earlier when I was young to get inspired but of course when I was young, I wasn't into F1, so I wouldn't have gotten inspired anyway. It's never been too late to get inspired.

This book is presented in Q&A format between Ross and Adam, whom I have never heard his name. I like when Ross giving answer and one particular thing I still remembered was sometime like - there's no championship winner with poor car, poor driver, or poor team finance. It's like you need everything to come at once to deliver a perfect result. There was a retrospective analysis of Ross himself after key moment in his career which is very interesting to hear from the man himself.

On the Adam Parr section, I skimmed through sections when he talks about Sunzi Chinese Military book. I probably need to go read that book before understanding the relavance.

---

### **Mark Webber**

_Racing, Read in 2021_

I have heard his name quite often in the commentaries because he appears as one of the commentators. His career at Redbull is fun to read and quite addictive because of a tense livary with Vettel. By opening this chaptor, it makes me want to read more about Redbull, Vettel, Helmul Marco. (I read about Adrian Newey before.)

---

### **Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone**

_Fiction, Read in 2019_

This book is by far the first fiction that I completed voluntarily - out of school reading assignment.

---

### **Sepiens: A Brief History of Humankind**, Yuval Noah Harari

_History, Read in 2019_

Many people talks about it. I came to interest in reading about it when I watched his TED talk, then I watched his longer interviews on youtube.

I wanted to test myself if I could finish a non-racing book. On that day, I simply walked to Kinokuniya in JEM and bought this book(I was living around Jurong East, Singapore). Yes, I proved to myself I can read non-racing book but more importantly this is indeed a good one. To me, this whole theory is about rendering cause-effect from one simple assumption which he explains with very good reasons. I have better view on how humanity has developed. I may revisit this book again someday.

---

### **Lewis Hamilton: My Story**

_Racing, Read in 2018_

The story of acquiring this book worths mentioning. I was on a vacation in UK with my girlfriend. We visited Silverstone where I purchased a ticket to drive a couple of laps on Ferrari F430. We also did Morgan Motor's factory tour on the same trip, and of course many other attractions. On the very end of our trips, we had free time in London, I supposed, and we went shopping. Something made me visited a secondhand shop. As I was in a motorsport mood, I sought for any books that fit the theme. I picked two books and this is one of the two.

Previously, I thought Lewis made F1 so boring because he keeps winning all the time, and I wondered why some fans like him so much. After finishing this book, it totally changes my view about him. I don't remember anything particular about this books that renders his life too well but it's his story that is meaningful in itself.

Back to 2020 when he won 7th F1 driver championship, I really admired his message - ""For all the kids out there who dream the impossible you can do it too, man."" Understanding who he is, I think it's very sensational and inspirational.

---

### **Prepare to Win**, Carroll Smith

_Racing, Read in 2018_

I can't remember much about it. I think it reiterate most of the content in _Tune to Win_ and more explanation on the preparation side. Personally, I prefer _Tune to Win_.

---

### **The Technique of Motor Racing**, Piero Taruffi

_Racing, Read in 2018_

With the same source of suggestion - Peter Windsor - and probably on the same youtube clip (I am not very sure). He mentioned about this book as a classic book on driving technique. Prior to reading this book, I only knew slow-in-fast-out as the only driving technique (when I drive on racing simulator).

Although this is not the best book about driving technique (to make you faster nowadays) but I enjoy travelling the time and learn one of the original racing lesson from mid 19'. I had this book secondhanded shipped from Amazon US. There's a note written on the blank page. It seems like the book was given by someone to someone who is entusiastic about racings. I am happy to have read this book.

---

### **Tune to Win**, Carroll Smith

_Racing, Read in 2018_

This is my first book about racing cars. I have long been interested in cars and racings since I was very young but I was very limited in knowledge and access to the information - noone around me as a kid is enthusiastic about racings, I barely understand English. I could only blame myself of not striving enough about racings.

In 2018, I was working in Singapore. I told myself to buy an F1 ticket to watch it for once and see whether I like it. I must say experience at the race track wasn't great (live TV is better) but then I exposed to the depth of motorsports and it recalls my childhood interests about racing. Since then, I started watching a lot of youtube clips about racing car mechanics, F1 history, everything I can find about cars. Then, I remembered (if only I remembered correctly), Peter Windsor, a motorsport journalist, mentioned in one of this commentary video about this book - Tune to Win.

I quickly downloaded the book and finished it in a week or two. This book is my entry ticket to the knowledge of car racings. It explains car physics in very comprehensible ways, of course not that easy to understand because car dynamics is a complex topic. The book has coverage enough to give an overview on how racing car works. I want to recommend this book to anyone who is interested in cars and wanted to know more how can one make a car faster than others.

## Books I am **trying** to read

These are books that I haven't finished and I have no plan to work on it. I must say I lost interest on them at the moment.

- _Don Quixote de La Mancha_

  I have heard so many good reviews about it. I like the theme song of "Donquijote" shopping mall. In fact, it's the shopping mall that brough my interest to get to know more on what exactly does it mean.

- _Harry Potter Book 2_

  Simply the continuation after completing the Book 1 but somehow I lost interest.
