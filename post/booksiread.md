# Books I read

I wish to keep this list alive by updating anytime I finish one book. The most recent ones are on top, ordering by chronological order.

### **Senna Versus Prost**
*Racing, Read in August 2021*

I have heard this famous duel from almost anybody that is into this sport. When I was watching a Senna documentary on Youtube, I found another replay of Senna driving in the wet unbelivably faster than his competitors. I knew very little about Prost and Niki's book (below) makes me curious to know more about him. 

So I have this book. I got to know more about Prost and Senna background. Their lifes before getting into F1 and during the time they are fighting each other at Mclaren. How did the situation develop? However, it says very very little about the events around Senna crash. I think the Senna's documentary that I watched before tells me more on Senna's crashing moment.

### **Enzo Ferrari: A Life**
*Racing, Read in 2021*

When I was young I didn't like supercars. They don't look like normal cars. F40 in racing games is so difficult to drive. I used to wonder why people like this brand so much. 

Since I drove a Ferrari at Silverstone and watching F1, I started to enjoy learning more about the supercars and Ferrari looks more and more beautiful to my eyes. I always hear commentaries about Ferrari's racing heritages which I had no idea about. So, I bought this book and read it. Hmmm, Yes, Ferrari is about racings. While reading this book, I started browsing photos of classic Ferraris mentioned. They are just so beautiful.

### **To Hell and Back by Niki Lauda**
*Racing, Read in 2021*

I knew very little about Niki. He was mentioned on many commentaries but the first time I really wanted to know more about him was around Monaco race when he has just passed away and people pay tributes to him. I started to watch some documentaries about him. Recently, I read a book about him. My personal take was you can pursue many interests in your life (he is a successful driver and he owns the airline).

### **The World Atlas of Coffee**, James Hoffmann
*Coffee, Read in 2021*

I like his youtube channel because I think his experiments sound scientific and reproducable. Thought I could hardly taste the different when I tried myself. I simply need more exposure to differential such a little difference. 

I like the first half of the book which is about coffee history. Since the main theme of this book is more of the encyclopedia, I think it's no exciting moment when reading. I would like to see more in future book about his thought on coffee things from a fair perspective (more opinion based not factual). The second half I didn't finish it because it is all about coffee growing regions (discretely explained by region). I sometimes revisit this section when I bought a new bean from a new region to learn the background.

### **Total Competition**, Ross Brawn and Adam Parr
*Racing, Read in 2021*

Reading about a famous engineering personnel - Brawn - only makes me wanted to be in F1 more. I wish I had such book earlier when I was young to get inspired but of course when I was young, I wasn't into F1, so I wouldn't have gotten inspired anyway. It's never been too late to get inspired.

This book is presented in Q&A format between Ross and Adam, whom I have never heard his name. I like when Ross giving answer and one particular thing I still remembered was sometime like - there's no championship winner with poor car, poor driver, or poor team finance. It's like you need everything to come at once to deliver a perfect result. There was a retrospective analysis of Ross himself after key moment in  his career which is very interesting to hear from the man himself. 

On the Adam Parr section, I skimmed through sections when he talks about Sunzi Chinese Military book. I probably need to go read that book before understanding the relavance.

### **Mark Webber**
*Racing, Read in 2021*

I have heard his name quite often in the commentaries because he appears as one of the commentators. His career at Redbull is fun to read and quite addictive because of a tense livary with Vettel. By opening this chaptor, it makes me want to read more about Redbull, Vettel, Helmul Marco. (I read about Adrian Newey before.)

### **Harry Potter Book 1**
*Fiction, Read in 2019*

This book is by far the first fiction that I completed voluntarily - out of school reading assignment. 

---
### **Sepiens: A Brief History of Humankind**, Yuval Noah Harari
*History, Read in 2019*

Many people talks about it. I came to interest in reading about it when I watched his TED talk, then I watched his longer interviews on youtube.

I wanted to test myself if I could finish a non-racing book. On that day, I simply walked to Kinokuniya in JEM and bought this book(I was living around Jurong East, Singapore). Yes, I proved to myself I can read non-racing book but more importantly this is indeed a good one. To me, this whole theory is about rendering cause-effect from one simple assumption which he explains with very good reasons. I have better view on how humanity has developed. I may revisit this book again someday.

### **Lewis Hamilton: My Story**
*Racing, Read in 2018*

The story of acquiring this book worths mentioning. I was on a vacation in UK with my girlfriend. We visited Silverstone where I purchased a ticket to drive a couple of laps on Ferrari F430. We also did Morgan Motor's factory tour on the same trip, and of course many other attractions. On the very end of our trips, we had free time in London, I supposed, and we went shopping. Something made me visited a secondhand shop. As I was in a motorsport mood, I sought for any books that fit the theme. I picked two books and this is one of the two.

Previously, I thought Lewis made F1 so boring because he keeps winning all the time, and I wondered why some fans like him so much. After finishing this book, it totally changes my view about him. I don't remember anything particular about this books that renders his life too well but it's his story that is meaningful in itself.

Back to 2020 when he won 7th F1 driver championship, I really admired his message - ""For all the kids out there who dream the impossible you can do it too, man."" Understanding who he is, I think it's very sensational and inspirational.

### **Prepare to Win**, Carroll Smith
*Racing, Read in 2018*

I can't remember much about it. I think it reiterate most of the content in *Tune to Win* and more explanation on the preparation side. Personally, I prefer *Tune to Win*.

### **The Technique of Motor Racing**, Piero Taruffi
*Racing, Read in 2018*

With the same source of suggestion - Peter Windsor - and probably on the same youtube clip (I am not very sure). He mentioned about this book as a classic book on driving technique. Prior to reading this book, I only knew slow-in-fast-out as the only driving technique (when I drive on racing simulator).

Although this is not the best book about driving technique (to make you faster nowadays) but I enjoy travelling the time and learn one of the original racing lesson from mid 19'. I had this book secondhanded shipped from Amazon US. There's a note written on the blank page. It seems like the book was given by someone to someone who is entusiastic about racings. I am happy to have read this book.

### **Tune to Win**, Carroll Smith
*Racing, Read in 2018*

This is my first book about racing cars. I have long been interested in cars and racings since I was very young but I was very limited in knowledge and access to the information - noone around me as a kid is enthusiastic about racings, I barely understand English. I could only blame myself of not striving enough about racings.

In 2018, I was working in Singapore. I told myself to buy an F1 ticket to watch it for once and see whether I like it. I must say experience at the race track wasn't great (live TV is better) but then I exposed to the depth of motorsports and it recalls my childhood interests about racing. Since then, I started watching a lot of youtube clips about racing car mechanics, F1 history, everything I can find about cars. Then, I remembered (if only I remembered correctly), Peter Windsor, a motorsport journalist, mentioned in one of this commentary video about this book - Tune to Win. 

I quickly downloaded the book and finished it in a week or two. This book is my entry ticket to the knowledge of car racings. It explains car physics in very comprehensible ways, of course not that easy to understand because car dynamics is a complex topic. The book has coverage enough to give an overview on how racing car works. I want to recommend this book to anyone who is interested in cars and wanted to know more how can one make a car faster than others.

## Books I am **trying** to read

These are books that I haven't finished and I have no plan to work on it. I must say I lost interest  on them at the moment.

- *Don Quixote de La Mancha*

    I have heard so many good reviews about it. I like the theme song of "Donquijote" shopping mall. In fact, it's the shopping mall that brough my interest to get to know more on what exactly does it mean. 

- *Harry Potter Book 2*

    Simply the continuation after completing the Book 1 but somehow I lost interest.
